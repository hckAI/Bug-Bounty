nikto 
---------

Nikto is a powerful assessment tools for finding vulnerabilities in web servers.

Scanning a host
nikto -h <Hostname/IP>

Scanning specific ports
nikto -h <Hostname/IP> -port <Port Number>,<Port Number>

Maximum scan time
nikto -h <Hostname/IP> -maxtime <Number in Seconds>

Scanning duration
nikto -h <Hostname/IP> -until

Disable SSL
nikto -h <Hostname/IP> -nossl

Force SSL
nikto -h <Hostname/IP> -ssl

Disable 404 guessing
nikto -h <Hostname/IP> -no404

Ignore negative responses. 302,301
nikto -h <Hostname/IP> -IgnoreCode <Code Number>

Update the plugins and databases
nikto -update

Specify host header
nikto -h <Hostname/IP> -vhost

Output results
nikto -h  <Hostname/IP> -output <filename>

Scanning through a proxy

Host authentication
nikto -h <Hostname/IP> -id <id:pass> or <id:pass:realm>

Database check
nikto -h <Hostname/IP> -dbcheck

Config file
